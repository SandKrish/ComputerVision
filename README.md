## [1.Face Mask Detection-Using PyTorch](https://github.com/SandKrish/ComputerVision/blob/main/face-mask-detection-using-pytorch.ipynb)
This notebook is used to identify three class of people:
* With mask
* Without mask
* Mask weared incorrect

Here PyTorch library is used with Deep Residual Learning, Resnet34 network. 

## [2. MNIST dataset analysis and prediction using LeNet-5 Architecture Convolutional Neural Network.](https://github.com/SandKrish/ComputerVision/blob/main/mnsit-cnn-with-augmentation.ipynb)
Contains detailed explanation of :
- RGB Format
- Convolutional Neural Network
- The LeNet-5 Architecture 
- Display of images of different convolutional layers.

## [3. Area_Bounded_by_two_boxes.](https://github.com/SandKrish/ComputerVision/blob/main/computer-vision-area-bounded-by-two-boxes.ipynb)
This program calculates total area of the bounding boxes and finds the intersection of points of two boxes.

## [1. Class Imbalance Dataset](https://github.com/SandKrish/Classification_Prediction/blob/main/imbalance-insurance-data-analysis.ipynb)
